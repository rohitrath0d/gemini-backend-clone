# Gemini AI Chat Backend

A powerful AI chat backend built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma**, and **RabbitMQ**, integrating Google Gemini AI for smart responses and Stripe for Pro subscriptions.

---

## Features

- User registration with OTP-based auth
- Gemini AI-powered chat replies (async via RabbitMQ)
- Chatroom + message support (with caching)
- Rate-limiting for Basic users (upgradable)
- Stripe Pro subscription with webhook handling
- Production-ready + Deployed on Render

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL database (e.g., [Neon](https://neon.tech))
- RabbitMQ running locally via Docker or use AMQP CloudAMQP (production friendly)
- Stripe account (for subscription management)
- Google Gemini API key ([get it here - GCP account required!](https://aistudio.google.com))

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitrath0d/gemini-backend-clone.git
cd gemini-backend-clone/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Variables

```env
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
CLIENT_URL=https://your-client-url.com
```

### Run the App Locally

```bash
node src/queues/consumer.js   # Queue Listener
npm start                     # Express Server
```

## Architecture Overview

```plaintext
Client App â†’ Express.js API
        â†“
     Prisma ORM â†’ PostgreSQL
        â†“
      RabbitMQ Queue
        â†“
Gemini AI â†’ Response â†’ DB â†’ Client
```

---

## Queue System Explanation

Messages are pushed into RabbitMQ â†’ picked up by a consumer â†’ passed to Gemini API â†’ response is saved to the DB asynchronously.

- Messages sent to /chatroom/:id/message are not immediately handled.
- They are pushed into RabbitMQ (queue: gemini_tasks).
- A consumer.js file continuously listens for incoming tasks.
- The task is sent to Gemini â†’ response is saved to DB â†’ client fetches from /chatroom/:id.

  This decouples slow AI calls and keeps the API fast.

---

## Gemini API Integration

Uses `@google/genai` to generate smart replies from user prompts.  
[Reference: Github Community official Setup Docs](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai)

- Uses @google/genai package.
- Gemini model: gemini-2.0-flash-001
- Gemini call happens inside the consumer via askGemini(prompt).
- Async response is written back to the message table (response column).

---

## Design Decisions & Assumptions

- OTP is mocked and returned directly  (no SMS provider included).
- Chatroom list cached with 5-min TTL.
- Rate limit for Basic users (10 messages/day) - using Nodecache.
- Webhook body is parsed with express.raw() for Stripe verification.
- Stripe checkout with webhook â†’ marks user as `pro`.

---

## How to Test in Postman

- Register & verify OTP to get JWT
   - POST /api/auth/signup
   - POST /api/auth/send-otp
   - POST /api/auth/verify-otp
- Use JWT as Bearer token for all secure routes
  - Authorization: Bearer < token >
- Chatroom/message routes are protected
  - POST /api/chatroom (Create)
  - GET /api/chatroom (List)
  - POST /api/chatroom/:id/message (Send Gemini message)
- Stripe payment can be tested with `4242 4242 4242 4242` card
  - POST /api/subscription/subscribe/pro â†’ Open sessionUrl
  - Fill card: 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any valid details
  - Stripe triggers /webhook/stripe
  - Use GET /api/subscription/status to confirm "pro" tier

- Check subscription with `/api/subscription/status`

---

## Deployment (Render)

- Add env vars in Render
- Start Command:
```bash
npm start && node src/queues/consumer.js
```
- Setup Stripe webhook to: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks`
